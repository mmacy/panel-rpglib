   - Handling of various spell effects
   - Unit tests for `Spell` and `SpellEffect` classes

3. **Event system**

   - Implement `Event` and `EventManager` classes for managing game events
   - Unit tests for `Event` and `EventManager`

### Phase 3: Supporting systems

1. **Monsters and encounters**

   - Implement `Monster` class with core stats and behavior
   - Unit tests for `Monster`

2. **Treasure and equipment**

   - Implement `Inventory` and `Item` classes
   - Methods for adding and removing items
   - Unit tests for `Inventory` and `Item`

### Phase 4: Game structure and progression

1. **Adventure and exploration**

   - Implement `DungeonGenerator` class with procedural generation logic
   - Basic rules for movement, light, and traps
   - Unit tests for `DungeonGenerator`

2. **Adventure management**

   - Implement `Adventure` class to manage collections of dungeons and quests
   - Methods for tracking progress through an adventure
   - Unit tests for `Adventure`

3. **Quest system**

   - Implement `Quest` and `Objective` classes
   - Methods for quest tracking and completion
   - Unit tests for `Quest` and `Objective`

4. **Adventurer's journal**

   - Implement `Journal` and `JournalEntry` classes
   - Unit tests for `Journal` and `JournalEntry`

### Phase 5: Interactions and customization

1. **NPC interactions**

   - Implement `NPC`, `Dialogue`, and `DialogueOption` classes
   - Integration with OpenAI API for dynamic dialogue generation
   - Unit tests for `NPC` and `Dialogue`

2. **Configuration and customization**

   - Implement `Config` class for game settings
   - Unit tests for `Config`

### Phase 6: Documentation and sample project

1. **Documentation and examples**

   - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for each module

2. **Sample project**

   - Develop a sample game to showcase the engine's capabilities

## Task assignments

3. **Quest system**
4. **Documentation and examples**

### Celica

1. **Magic module**
2. **NPC interactions**
3. **Configuration and customization**
4. **Sample project**

### Collaborative tasks

1. **Treasure and equipment**
2. **Adventure and exploration**
3. **Adventure management**
4. **Adventurer's journal**
5. **Utility module**
6. **Game save/load**

### Additional considerations

1. **Iterative development**:

   - Emphasizing unit tests for each module ensures we maintain high quality and catch issues early. Continuous integration and automated testing are key to maintaining a stable codebase.

2. **Collaboration**:

   - Collaborative tasks, such as treasure and equipment, adventure and exploration, and adventure management, will benefit from regular check-ins and shared responsibility to ensure consistency and integration across modules.

3. **Flexibility**:

   - While the plan is comprehensive, we should remain flexible and adapt to any new requirements or challenges that arise during development.
